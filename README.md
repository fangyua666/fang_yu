# Academic Projects
**Netflix Prize**
- Processed 180,000 recent [ratings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XHeYTwgp9M4-V3shLd2loemdaoQGhi6d) with time-based splitting.
- Implemented neighborhood-based methods including NB-CORR and NB-LS from scratch to compute similarity scores and leverage user-item correlations, achieving test RMSE of 0.9751 and 0.9583 respectively.
- Developed an ensemble model using linear regression to combine predictions from matrix factorization and neighborhood-based models to enhance overall accuracy. Fine-tuned weights with OLS, achieving a test RMSE of 0.9262.
- Performed EDA and visualized the relationships between hyperparameters and RMSE to evaluate model performance.
